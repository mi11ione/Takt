Targets & frameworks
- Minimum iOS 18. SwiftUI-only app; single app target with Widget Extension as needed.
- Use latest Swift features (incl. macros). Use only Apple native frameworks.

Architecture & concurrency
- THE VIEW architecture; no ViewModels. Protocol-oriented services via Environment.
- Swift Concurrency for all async work (async/await, Task/TaskGroup, AsyncStream, Actors).

Core platform APIs to prefer
- SwiftData for persistence, `@Observable` macro, `.sensoryFeedback()`, `NavigationStack`, `Inspector()`, `ContentUnavailableView`, Live Activities, interactive widgets (AppIntents), TipKit, `.scrollPosition()`, PhaseAnimator.

UX baselines
- Dynamic Type, dark mode, smooth spring animations, loading/empty states patterns, pull-to-refresh.

Prohibitions
- No deprecated APIs. No Combine/GCD/completion handlers. No thirdâ€‘party dependencies. No custom payment processing.

Build expectations
- App compiles immediately in Xcode with zero extra setup; only Apple frameworks used.
