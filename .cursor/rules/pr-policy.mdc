- Single-purpose PR; keep the diff minimal and scoped.
- PR body must include: Summary, Scope (files/targets), Motivation, Risks & rollback plan, and any manual checks performed.
- Reference relevant context files when applicable (e.g., `@prompt.md`, `@the-view-architecture.md`).
- Do not merge; leave the PR open for human review.
